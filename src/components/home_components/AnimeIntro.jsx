          Anime and Its Growing Culture in India
        </h1>

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
          Anime, once considered a niche form of entertainment in India, has
          evolved into a vibrant cultural movement embraced by millions. What
          started with late-night television broadcasts and pirated DVDs has
          transformed into a mainstream phenomenon driven by streaming
          platforms, fan communities, and social media.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
          Indian anime fans connect deeply with themes of perseverance,
          friendship, identity, and self-growth values that resonate strongly
          across cultures. From action-packed shōnen series to emotionally rich
          slice-of-life stories, anime offers narratives that go far beyond
          conventional cartoons.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
          Today, anime culture in India thrives through conventions, cosplay,
          fan art, fan fiction, and online discussions. College communities and
          clubs play a major role in bringing fans together, creating spaces
          where passion turns into creativity and shared experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-blue-300">
          Anime is no longer just something we watch. It’s something we live,
          discuss, create, and celebrate together.
